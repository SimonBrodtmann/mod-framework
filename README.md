# Mod Framework

This framework provides barebone pieces for Factorio with an easy to use API. Builders, customizing options and the
ability to apply your own adjustments easily, enable you to rapidly develop cool mods without spending too much time
finding the right graphics and the code for them for your ideas.

See the [API documentation](https://simonbrodtmann.github.io/mod-framework/) for more information on how to use this framework.
